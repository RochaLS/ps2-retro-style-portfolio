# 🎮 PS2-Style Developer Portfolio  
**A nostalgic PlayStation 2–inspired portfolio built with React + Vite + Tailwind.**  
A tribute to childhood gaming — memory card UI, CRT effects, PS2 sounds, retro icons, and smooth controller-style navigation.

## ⭐ About This Project  
This portfolio is heavily inspired by the **PlayStation 2 Memory Card interface**, one of the most iconic menus in gaming history.  

I wanted my portfolio to feel fun, nostalgic, and personal — something that blends my love for gaming and design while still showcasing my software development projects.

The result?

- 🎚 CRT filter  
- 🎵 Authentic PS2 sound effects  
- 🎞 Smooth 3D-style animations  
- 🎮 Arrow-key navigation  
- 💾 Memory-card-style project grid  
- 🟦 Pixelated retro tech logos  
- 🌌 Soft PS2-style gradients & glows  

Built entirely with modern web technologies.
